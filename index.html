        <p>Hello and welcome. I’m Heather Shakespeare, a writer and writing for wellbeing facilitator living at the heart of the beautiful Surrey Hills in the UK.</p>
      </div>
      <p>I have many years of experience teaching English and Creative Writing in a variety of settings including colleges, schools and prisons. More recently I have been following a different path after witnessing – and experiencing first hand – the freedom and possibilities of writing purely for oneself, without any of the rules and expectations embodied in curricula and mark schemes. My focus now as a writing facilitator is on the writing process and its potential to enhance wellbeing and encourage self-development, both personally and professionally.</p>
      <p>Alongside this, I write poetry for the pleasure (and pain) of it, and because sometimes it resonates with those who care to read or listen to it.</p>
